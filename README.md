# Global Game Jam, 201+

Result of the 48 hour Global Game Jam, 2016, following the jam theme "Ritual". See the game page listing: http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/gorge-souls

A multiplayer (local), isometric game set in a dilapidated monastery in which players must roam about to collect followers, and use their dark "push" powers to push them into the pit. Players win once they have sacrificed the majority share of followers, but beware your rivals claiming your followers as their own.
